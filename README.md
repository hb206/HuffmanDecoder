### HuffmanDecoder
Program that can compress and decompress files without losing data using Huffman Encoding
## Preliminary Step:
Run MakeCode.Java, input name of the file you'd like to use (hamlet.txt) and an output file to store codes (hamlet.code). This generates the codes needed to encode and decode the file.
## To Encode:
Run Encode.Java. When promted, enter input file name (hamlet.txt), code file name generated from MakeCode.Java (hamlet.code), and  a name for the compressed output file that will be created (hamlet.short).
## To Decode:
Run Decode.Java, provide the name of the compressed file (hamlet.short) and code file (hamlet.code). The output (Hamlet.new) will contain the same contents as the original text file (hamlet.txt). That's it!
